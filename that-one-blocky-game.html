</code></pre><p>On November 18, 2011, Minecraft became the most sold game in the world, with 200 million copies sold across the globe. The reason for its popularity is the flexibility of the game. You get to choose how it is you want to play, and that makes it a suitable game for many different types of people. You can choose whether you just want to beat survival mode or make a giant mansion in creative mode. The game conforms to the player and not the other way around. This is not only because of freedom of gameplay, it’s also because of local multiplayer servers, server plugins, and the modding community. It has one of the biggest modding communities of all time, making for much more content than just the base game. Since Minecraft has a very simple pixel art style, modders can easily create textures for mods. Its simplistic design allows for an easier understanding of the game’s mechanics and allows it to run easily on low-end devices. It has an extremely large amount of supported platforms from iPhone, Android, Xbox, Playstation, Windows, Mac, and Switch. Almost anyone can play Minecraft and can play the game in almost any way they would like, that’s what makes Minecraft such a good game. Minecraft is a world based on the idea that everything (almost) is the shape of a cube. Minecraft uses simple pixel textures with bright colors to create a vibrant infinite world. For survival, the many different difficulties suit each different type of player, in this mode, you have to manage hunger and health. You have a finite amount of inventory space and you have to gather resources. There is also a creative mode in which you don’t have health or hunger, and you have access to any block or item in the game. This game mode has no limits to what you can do, so what exactly you do is up to you. Another aspect of the game that stuck with me to this day is the music. Minecraft has an instrumental ambient music track (by C418) and has been considered to be some of the best video game music of all time or at least one of the most popular. It has a quiet calming soundtrack that is similar to the feeling of sitting at the furnace on a cold winter night. For people that have played the game for a long time, it is an extremely nostalgic experience. It makes my hair stand up, and there is nothing else like that for me. I remember the exact moment when I heard about Minecraft, it was when I was younger and at a summer drama camp. They were talking about this game I had never heard of before while we were working on a project. I was intrigued by the concept, and I asked them what the game that they were talking about was. They told me about this game called Minecraft, and for the rest of the camp day, I was repeating the name of it to myself because I wanted to find it when I got home. When I got home, I excitedly rushed to the computer to search up the game and found the Minecraft website. At first glance, I saw the trailer for Minecraft which I watched. I’m not sure why, but I liked something about the trailer. The narrator’s calming voice explaining what the game was about made it nice to watch. I would every so often come back to watch the trailer again. The price was something around 20 dollars at the time, but I thought this was a lot since I was a kid. I eventually started searching for a free version of the game but instead ended up downloading many fake Minecraft Exe files which ended up being viruses. I did eventually find one that functioned, but sometimes it wouldn’t launch, and whenever I got it up I would play for as long as I could before the family laptop would die. Even on the charger, the laptop would still die, which I got very annoyed with. I have a very good memory of my first time playing Minecraft, I first played at one of my neighbor’s houses. He was playing a game on his iPad and when I leaned over to look, I was surprised and recognized the game immediately. I asked him if I could play, and he went to get another iPad so we could play together. We were on a small island in the middle of the ocean, with no other land to be seen. I was mining blocks and reading their names to try to figure out the game. It eventually turned night, monsters started to spawn around the island, and we tried to fend them off. We ended up running away since there were too many. Soon after it turned day and all the monsters burned up in the sun, it was time for me to go home. When I got home, I got the idea to buy Minecraft on my Kindle because it would be cheaper on mobile. When I checked I could only find bootlegs of the game which I ended up downloading. None of them were the same as Minecraft so I kept checking to see if it would get added to the store. I checked every single day for many months waiting for it to come out for the Kindle. One day while I was in the basement with my kindle messing around with some games, I decided to check the game store. When I searched Minecraft the first result was the actual game, I got super excited and screamed. I frantically ran upstairs and jumped up and down (as excited kids do), asking my mom if I could get the game with the five dollars I had saved up. I immediately paid my mother, and I bought the game on my Kindle. I would play the game all day long until I had to go to bed, and at one point I even started getting up at five in the morning just to play before school. I would play with my brother, my friends, or anyone else who had the game. Many years later I wanted to play the pc version of the game, and at some point, my mom ended up buying it for me and helping me set up the account. I now started to play Minecraft on the pc, and first I only played a single-player by myself. I ended up finding out about how the library computers had Minecraft on their pcs, I was very excited to go try it out. My best friend at the time, Tanner, and I would sometimes bike to the local library and play Minecraft with people there. I very soon found out about commands which are cheats that would allow you to do things that are normally not possible. The next time we got to the library, I wanted to show off some of my skills. Some kid was killing people for no reason, in particular, my parents say that I would come home upset about the whole thing. I eventually learned enough about commands that I could get back at him, and when he came to the library that day I did. I used a command that made him permanently blind, he looked confused and started yelling about how he couldn’t see. I have served him justice and felt pretty good about it, and so kids started asking me about commands. So I started teaching them about Minecraft commands which I enjoyed. I came home that day with a smile on my face telling my parents that I had got him. I even went as far as trying to apply for a moderator on a Minecraft server, which didn’t go very well since you could tell how old I was from my public application (this makes me cringe). Not long after this, I found out about this thing called modding from watching youtube videos, and this at the time got me obsessed with Minecraft again. I tried for so long trying to figure out how to install mods, and with a lot of viruses downloaded I finally figured out how to get a mod pack. These mods made the game a completely brand new experience once again. I started with Big Dig and from there played other Technic mod packs, this was until I found out about Sky Factory. This was probably the most memorable, you start with just a single dirt block and a tree, and the rest of the world is an empty void. From this, you would create giant machines that would automate complicated processes to make materials. An example of one of these machines would be the automatic lava machine. It would use lava and water to create cobble which would be automatically mined and melted in a crucible with heat. Then the lava would be transferred to a lava generator which would then make power. I would continue to automate large machines to bigger and more complicated extents, making a giant factory in the sky. This would continue my interests in Minecraft for many years to come as I had so much new content. At the time I also joined a Sky Factory server and started talking to the people on the server. I ended up making a couple of friends on the server, including one of the moderators. She was on a lot so I got to talk to her a bit about Sky Factory and other things related to it. I kept playing around with mods until around my 8th-grade year of middle school when I started to get interested in computers. Around this time I started to learn about PCs and the parts that make them up. I ended up saving for a pc and getting one a couple of years later. With the power of the new pc, I started to learn about making Minecraft servers. I started with vanilla Minecraft servers that would allow my friends to connect from other internet connections. A small group of friends and I started to play some Minecraft mods packs, and we slowly grew into a large group of Lincoln students that played on a vanilla Minecraft server sophomore/junior year. I ended up dealing with a lot of serving making and computer troubleshooting, and this grew my knowledge of computers even more. My friends at the time showed me the operating system Linux, which required me to understand more about computers to use. Minecraft is more than just a game to me, it gave me a lot of happy memories as a kid. It also created a lot of my interest in computers that lead to me wanting to go to DSU. This is also the reason why I am here at CTE to learn more about computers. It all started at one point, which was somehow Minecraft. Since I was used to using Windows and dealing with viruses, I would help my Grandparents with their computer issues. This sparked interest in learning more about computers to help others. Minecraft was like a small snowball rolling down the hill slowly growing bigger eventually leading to today. If I hadn’t played Minecraft I wouldn’t have been interested in computers, I wouldn’t have built a pc, I wouldn’t have learned to code, and I wouldn’t have tried any of the other stuff I have today. That is why this game is so important to me, it made me who I am today.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on May 18, 2021</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/authors/asher-griess/" class="invert" rel="author">Asher Griess</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/why-the-world-burns.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Why The World Burns </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
