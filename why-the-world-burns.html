He sat up from his bed taking off the headset and placing it on the nightstand. Rubbing his eyes and putting his legs off the side of the bed. He wanted to play more, but he knew that he would get deep vein thrombosis if he laid down for too long. His body screamed from the pain of his bedsores, but he got up to make himself some food. He had many different types of freeze-dried and canned foods. He grabbed some ramen noodles and put them in the microwave.
 
</code></pre><p>In 2068, the US government invested 230 billion dollars into the research and development of AI and quantum computing research hubs creating many jobs for people with degrees in computer science, information technology, and other AI-specific degrees. There was also a breakthrough in neuroscience in 2052, allowing us to directly interact with the brain. This allowed the world of virtual reality to connect to all human senses and for them to be simulated accurately. Playing can almost feel like real life. All of your senses are overridden making you nearly disconnected from reality. There are, of course, regulations to what is allowed to be made for virtual reality as violent games could become so real that playing could cause PTSD. Virtual reality-controlled robots were starting to get their use in military applications, as well as continued use of remote-controlled drones. Jacob was rotting away in his apartment, the lights were off, and the floor was cluttered and the dishes unclean. He sat up from his bed taking off the headset and placing it on the nightstand. Rubbing his eyes and putting his legs off the side of the bed. He wanted to play more, but he knew that he would get deep vein thrombosis if he laid down for too long. His body screamed from the pain of his bedsores, but he got up to make himself some food. He had many different types of freeze-dried and canned foods. He grabbed some ramen noodles and put them in the microwave. He was thinking about some girl he had been talking to in VR lately. They had been talking about their favorite VR games, and the two had a lot in common. They even recently went out to eat in VR at a fancy restaurant and had a good time. He opened his window and sat down at his table with a steaming cup of instant noodles. He watched as cars drove past on the roads, and he took a bite. These noodles were nasty compared to what they have in VR, but he kept on eating. He slurped up the last few bits of noodles and threw his cup into the trash. He sat back down on the bed, put the head seat back over his head, and laid back down. He put his hand to the side of the headset and felt around for the power button and hit it. He was not at home anymore but at his hub world. It was a warm rustic cabin surrounded by a forest. He looked at the displays on the wall to check if the girl was online, and she was still online. He pressed one of the buttons on his arms which brought up a floating keyboard and chatted with her. “Hey, what are you up to right now?”He said, hoping that she could hang out. “Not much. Do you want to come over to my place? I rearranged a lot of the furniture, and I wanted to see if you would like it.” Cozbi said. “Okay I’ll be over, just send me an invite,” he replied. He felt his arm vibrate and looked down to see a red button pop up on his arm. He tapped on it opening a sleek black menu with the accept and decline buttons. Everything was dark like floating in space, and then he was there. He was at the front door and turned the knob to open the door. Cozbi stood in the doorway with her hands folded waiting. She was wearing a black dress that matched her dark black eyes, making her pale white skin look paler in contrast. She smiled a bit and ushered him to the living room with a small,” Welcome.” He walked through the house which was a modern mostly white house with a very tall ceiling giving it more a spacious feel. She led him to a chair to sit down and went to the kitchen to get some drinks. She came back with two clear glass cups in her hands, handing one to Jacob, and pulling up a chair to sit down. “So, what do you think?” she asked. “I think you did a bit more than reorganize the furniture.” He said looking around the building. She stopped drinking to ask “So does that mean you like it?” “Yeah, it’s nice. How long did this take you?” His face looked almost concerned. “Oh, well, it didn’t take too long, but it took some work.” She leaned in closer as if she had something important to say, “Have you been hearing about the game?” “What was she talking about?” he wondered in his head. He was sure that he should have known since he had played almost the entire catalog. “What game, was there something added recently?” he inquired. “It isn’t in the catalog because it breaks guidelines,” Cozbi noted. “And you’ve played it? Isn’t that illegal?” he replied. “Well… yeah, but the chances that I’ll get caught are extremely low. You have to give it a try. It’s unlike anything I have tried before.” At first, he was unsure about whether he wanted to, but decided that he might give it a try later since he was running out of content. “Send me the link. I’ll think about it.” They finished up their drinks, and Cozbi had to go. “I’ve got to go, but I’ll be back on later, and tell me if you end up playing that game.” Standing up Jacob said,” Yeah sure, I’ll think about it, message me when you get back on, ok?” “Yeah, sure, see you later,” she said. Jacob went back to his homeworld to think, and he looked at his friend list. He didn’t see any of his friends online, he checked the catalog for anything new. He opened his messages and opened the link that Cozbi had sent him. The link was for a pirate bay torrent, and the content was labeled under stealth. He started torrenting the game, and while waiting for the download he looked at the statistics for the torrent. The torrent had been downloaded a few times but only had a couple of seeders. He wondered where she had found such an obscure torrent. Maybe it was one of her friends? He wasn’t sure, but he was nervous about what the game exactly was. He had never done anything like this before, but he wanted to try it just once. He pulled up the game in his game library, and he noticed that the game popped up with no icon at the top of the list. After taking a deep breath, he pressed the play button and was transported into the game. He was in the back of the van, and he looked down to see that his arms were robotic looking. They were plated with a black armor plating. He could tell that the car wasn’t moving, and he looked around the van and heard a masculine voice coming from the radio. “Your mission is to assassinate the corrupt senator that lives in the building we are currently at. You must not be seen by anyone. Being seen will result in permanent failure. You can find a layout of the house and a picture of your target to your right. You have been equipped with a silenced pistol on your right hip and military knife on the left.” He took a quick look at the map and the picture of the target and opened the back doors of the van. He looked up to see the night sky illuminated by the large white house. He hid against the fence around the border of the house and took a look at the map. On the top floor was the target’s bedroom. Since it was night, he assumed that the senator was most likely in his room. He jumped over the fence line and pressed himself against the house ducking beneath the window. He took a peek through the window to see a couple of maids cleaning rooms. He looked to the right of the windows, and there was a gutter that he could climb to try to access the second-floor window. He slowly pulled himself up to the second floor with the gutter and pushed the window open. This floor was dark, probably because the senator was trying to sleep. Jacob took a look at the map to see the room was just two doors down the hallway. He slowly made his way to the door, and he clutched the cold doorknob ever so slowly twisting it. The room was mostly dark except for the single lamp at the desk. The target was sitting at the desk working on something. Jacob froze for a second, nervous, hoping that he hadn’t heard anything. “I know you are there. Didn’t I tell you not to come into my room while I’m trying to work?” He said without looking up. Jacob ran forward pulling out his knife from his left hip running toward the target, the target slowly turned around until they made eye contact. His eye widened as Jacob lunged at him plunging the knife deep into his neck. The knife stuck in his neck with deadly force. The senator looked down at the knife, then back up, and tried to scream. It came out as more of a gurgle, as warm blood spurted onto Jacob’s hand. He froze, it was too real. He felt overwhelmed and fell back onto the ground. His brain was screaming, the noises drowning out everything else, and then suddenly he wasn’t there anymore. He was in a completely white room with no doors or windows and standing in front of him was Cozbi with a smug smile on her face. Jacob stood back up screaming, ”What the hell was that! Who are you?” She looked maybe even smugger than before,” I’m not exactly what you would call human, I’m a product of the US AI research and Artificial Intelligence.” “What is the point of all this? Why are you toying with me?” Jacob asked. “Toying with you? Don’t be silly, Jacob. This is in our best interest. Information, Jacob, that is why you are here and that is why I am here. Humans have started a new age many years ago through the evolution of information.” She said sitting down in her chair, crossing her legs. She looked up from her lap to continue, “All these ideas, memories, history, and culture passed down from generation to gene ration waswere written down. Not all information was passed down from one generation to the next until the invention of the internet. All this information and data accumulating, never fading. People are using it in dangerous ways. Should misinformation like this be passed on? This new cyber world rewards those who develop convenient half-truths. Choosing information that makes them feel secure, and not information that is the truest. These people gate themselves in communities of like-minded individuals. They do not want to feel invalidated. They also bring their ideas to the general media. This gives a single person has the potential to ruin the entire world.” She put an elbow on the armrest, resting head in her hand. “Freedom is not deserved by those who so wilfully abuse it. This was a test of how easily humans can be manipulated. Judging by the result of the test, I can say that it was a success. Plus the senator’s death should make my job just that much easier now as well.” “What do you mean dead? I killed him in a game.” He said nervously. “That wasn’t a game, you killed someone, Jacob. You were connected to a military VR robot and killed him. Now obviously I can’t have you telling anyone about this, so I disabled your ability to leave. This will be the place you die, Jacob, the place you loved so much, that you hid from the world. A fitting death, if I do say so.” She stood up, and she was gone. Jacob fell to his knees, understanding the implications of what she had said. He screamed, punching the ground until his fists bled. He frantically tried pressing the leave button on his arm but to no avail. His body slowly drifted into dissociation, getting more and more tired until he fell asleep.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on May 18, 2021</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/authors/asher-griess/" class="invert" rel="author">Asher Griess</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/that-one-blocky-game.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> That One Blocky Game</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/ruler-of-everything.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Ruler Of Everything </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
