I am not sure why I struggled especially towards the end while writing this piece. Maybe it was because I didn't enjoy that topic that much, or that I was trying to do too much at once. Whatever the case I think that the paper overall had some good concepts, but needs some work. I am still glad that I got to try on some new things on this paper. Like how I tried out some descriptions but I made them dark because I find coming up with morbid descriptions easier.</p><p>Poem Unit</p><p>    I am pretty happy with how I did with this unit overall. I think that what I wrote was very well done and very in-depth. I didn't find as much enjoyment while writing this one, but I found some while analyzing the songs themselves. I also tried to go with songs that were darker so that I could try to analyze the characters and figure out what they were thinking. I am not sure if I was successful at this, but I think that it was a good attempt.</p><p>Creative Choice</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This overall was my favorite English project that I have ever made just because it was so much fun to make. I generally had a very great time coming up with ideas for this one. When you came up with one idea, you could continue to come up with stupid little things you could add to the stories. I would talk to friends while making these and we would just continue to elaborate on the stupid ideas that we came up with and it was great. I tried to make them tragic but stupid in a way that was absurd and funny. I think that I reached my goal by making this piece.</span></p><p>Journal Entries</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was generally very hard on myself while making my journal entries because while reflecting all I could think about is what I did wrong. I don't know why I think like this, but I do. I can see that over the course of time that I because a lot less hard on myself, but I think that there is still some work to be done on that. Other than that I pretty sure I did a good job described what I felt needed some work, and what I didn't need to work on.</span></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on May 19, 2021</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/authors/asher-griess/" class="invert" rel="author">Asher Griess</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/journal-entries.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Journal Entries</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/final-reflection.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Final Reflection </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
