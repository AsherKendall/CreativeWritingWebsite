For the second article, I know pretty much everything that I am going to write, and I will add to it a bit as I go. The articles are actually really fun to come up with, I find it entertaining to come up with the ideas and imagine them playing out. I sort of imagine them as news reports because I can picture them perfectly. I would love to make a video of one of the articles but I would need people to help make it, and it would probably take too much time.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So far I think that I am doing quite well on the project, I already have one article almost finished.  Some of the ideas I didn’t think that I could make a full article out of so I ended up making them related articles. For this project I am really not having any trouble coming up with ideas since I got to choose. I have a couple ideas for other articles that I might end up making, but I am not sure about all of them so I’ll have to see. I am going to try to start my second article to finish my project, so far I am pretty satisfied with the results.</span></p><p>I need to work on the structure of my sentences and the punctuation that goes with them. It can be choppy and repetitive, and sometimes weirdly worded. I struggle to find the right way to make a sentence flow. I also need to figure out when to quote the poem and when to paraphrase as I couldn’t find a good balance between them. Overall I think that I like the ideas that are presented in the analysis, but the way I present them could be worked on.</p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first thing that I want to change about the way I use the POV, is the use of pronouns. I want to try not to use pronouns as much especially when there is only one person in the scene. The use of pronouns in scenes like this draws attention away from the story and doesn’t add anything to the story. Sometimes I might even replace the pronouns with descriptive adjectives. This should hopefully keep the reader interested in the story, and not focused on the continued use of pronouns.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have given thought to use other types of POV but I don’t think that they would work as well. The only one that would make sense to me would be either of the first persons, but I think it would be hard to relate to the character’s extreme properties. So I am going to stick to 3rd Person Limited for now since I think it best fits the story. I might try to let the reader know a little more about what the main character is thinking</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To be honest, I was very close to not taking creative writing because of all the English subjects, this is the one I am worst at. I still decided to take it because the other classes would still require more work. Personal narrative writing is also one of the types of writing that I am really not good at. Partly because of my lack of experience, and because I don’t like writing about myself(especially sharing that writing). When I write I generally write papers that I think have interesting topics and that I personally am interested in, and where I take an idea and delve deeper into it. One thing, in particular, I am not good at is describing scenes, I feel that whenever I do, it feels wrong, out of place, and generic. But I want to be better at this because I hate being bad at it, I want to get better at this. I hope this class shows me how to improve, and I think I have a couple of ideas for future projects. My strengths are that when I come up with ideas, there are usually pretty good ones. I just need to figure out how to express these ideas in a good way.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I will try to use a description of items that reflect my feelings in the current moment, this is especially because I am not very good at describing things. I think I will also try to bring the reader through my thought process behind the whole thing, this will probably apply the most to the second part of my essay where I describe my Grandma’s death. The first paragraph is a background that explains what happened, and why I feel the way I do about her. I also noticed how he cut his story into small parts and will try to make my transitions more smooth, this is more of a general thing because I feel like I don’t try for transitions when they are very important.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Honestly, I have been enjoying the class a lot more than I thought I would have. I thought that these types of papers weren’t my style of writing and that they would be difficult for me to write about, but now that I have figured out how to write them in my own way. I need to write about something that I am passionate about and not about something serious that others can relate to. This makes it very difficult for me to write a paper because I am unsure about the content because it’s not who I am. So now that I have a solid understanding of how to write in this class, I now just need to figure out how to improve my writing. </span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think that I am going to go in the direction of flash fiction because of the topic I want to cover. I am planning on doing a science fiction piece about artificial intelligence and the flow of information. To write a piece like this I am going to need it to be longer so flash fiction would make the most sense. I want to use the common problems with the flow of information today like misinformation and fake news and add the topic of artificial intelligence to the topic. Bringing up the topic of whether we should have the freedom to choose want information we believe in. Should what we get to see be controlled by AI in order to progress humanity to something greater, that is what I want to cover.</span></p><p> </p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I want to make specific parts more dramatic, there are many ways I want to achieve this but I’ll try them and see how they go. I really need to go through the whole essay and try to get rid of some of he/him parts. With the end dialogue, I want there to be more motion from the main character in the part, so that the dialogue doesn’t drone on. I also need to work on commas in a lot of the essay, but that should be relatively straightforward to fix. I need to find what I like and what I don’t like and change or remove it.</span></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on May 19, 2021</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/authors/asher-griess/" class="invert" rel="author">Asher Griess</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/local-it-guy-struggles-to-make-money.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Local IT Guy Struggles to Make Money</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/reflections.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Reflections </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
