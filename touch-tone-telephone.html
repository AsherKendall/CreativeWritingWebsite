I'm the only one<br>On your A.M., A.M. radio</p><p>Touch-Tone Telephone Analysis</p><p>&nbsp; &nbsp; This song is named after push-button telephones which were popularized to replace rotary dial telephones. Throughout the song, the main character in the story uses his push-button telephone to call radio stations. By using the phone, the man talks about conspiracy theories to the radio talk show host. As the story continues we get to more of how he feels about society and how he thinks of himself. We follow him as he explains how it is he sees the world.<br>He starts the song by saying that he needs to reveal the truth about himself and the show host. He then claims that they are a new species, this could be because he thinks that they are half-alien or mutants, since he thinks that they are both the same. The reason he does this is to make a reason for himself why he is not accepted, he feels better about himself because he is different. It then says the line “ Big Cats.”, which is a reference to the conspiracy British Big Cats. They are large cats that are in the British Isles that are not native to the area and roam around. Conspiracy theorists claim they are anomalies or of extraterrestrial origin. He then makes another reference, this time a conspiracy about Nazis going to space in UFOs to time travel. Then two names are mentioned in the song, Robert Stack and Leonard Nimoy. Robert Stack used to host the TV show Unsolved Mysteries, which included unsolved crimes, conspiracy theories, and supposed paranormal activity. Leonard Nimoy was mostly known for playing Spock in Star Trek, and this ties with the themes of the main character’s theories. This gives us a potential link in the character’s past that lead him down this path.<br>The character starts to talk again about the radio host and how he wants to call them. He would try to call every day but gets too nervous to actually call. He has been working on a theory, and if he survives everyone has to listen to what he has to say, maybe because he thinks that his knowledge puts him in danger. He then references the fact that he uses his push-button telephone to make the calls to the AM radio show. Now he is crying telling himself that no one else could understand, that only the radio show host would understand him. He has created a persona for the host that he believes to be his only friend. He keeps trying to build up enough courage to make the call until he eventually makes it.<br>We start off mid-way through the conversation as the main character is telling the host not to hang up yet. Upset and flustered, he claims that he is smarter than everyone else and that it is better to be made fun of than be wrong. He makes claims about UFOlogy, which is the study of mysterious objects seen in the sky. Again talking about Ancient Aliens who were thought to have helped the early humans getting us to our current point. He claims to all the listeners that don’t believe that someday they will know that he is right and that not believing him would lead to their realization that they were wrong. He might be found in the Super-Sargasso Sea, which is a theory about a place where lost items go to. When things are lost they are teleported to another dimension, and this would also imply that he feels lost or alone since no one will believe him.<br>The character throughout the story is shown to be clearly mentally deranged believing that everything is a lie. He would listen to the radio and listen to the theories being able to feel like he was part of the community since no one else would believe him. Wanting to feel accepted by someone, he eventually gets himself to call, which leads to him being rejected by the host of the show. Refusing to give up his view on the world he exclaims that he is right and that everyone will be sorry when they learn the truth. He is unable to come to grips with humanity, he rejects society making his descent deeper into insanity.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on May 18, 2021</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/authors/asher-griess/" class="invert" rel="author">Asher Griess</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/cabinet-man.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Cabinet Man</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/entire-classroom-found-dead-after-2-months-2.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Entire Classroom Found Dead After 2 Months </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
