His music has a reputation for using a variety of unique styles and being very morbid. Many of his songs have themes of murder, the supernatural, and death. This song also shows many themes similar to those of the urban Legend Polybius, which is a fictional arcade game that would drive players insane. Cabinet Man follows a similar trend, in this case describing a man who becomes a cabinet machine. The manner in which he became an arcade cabinet is unclear, however, it is stated that he was found in a shed behind an arcade, and he was reported to be missing on the news. He was then placed inside the arcade as it was assumed that the machine was meant to be there. It also implied that his organs are stored inside of the machine, such as his lungs which are used to store coins (or to push on his diaphragm), and his heart is gently beeping instead of beating.<br>Then the song switches to the chorus which states: “You can't win me, I can't be beaten. I won't hurt you, unless you cheat. You can't see me behind the screen. I'm half human and half machine.” He affirms that he can’t be beat, which is a recanting of how old arcades used to be. Arcade cabinets were purposely designed to be hard to beat, this was in an effort to extract as much money as possible. Most arcade machines were impossible to beat as they either broke when you got too far or just kept going. This is then followed by him saying that he is friendly unless you cheat, which is talked about more later in the song. He then talks about how he looks exactly like a normal arcade machine, but that he is half human and half machine.<br>We then get a better understanding of the character himself and about his life before becoming a cabinet machine. He is thankful for the business generated by the arcade as it gave him the opportunity to be played and the players who enjoyed playing the games. He likens the feeling of people enjoying playing him to love, implying that he had not experienced love in his previous life. He was happy that people would come from miles away just to play his game. He was unable to find someone that appreciated who he was, but now at the arcade, he was able to find people who did.<br>This when the poem starts to take a darker turn, with him restating that he was happy for many years. Mentioning how he only ate the occasional maintenance man, which is how he gets nutrients to live since he is unable to move. He also mentions that he drove some kids to madness. This part is unclear how he did this or why he did it as well, but he mentions that maybe they might have already been crazy which probably isn’t true. But in the end, he doesn’t care because he is only there to have fun. He then mentions that he doesn’t have much time left because of the home console being released from Japan. This is talking about when arcade games became less and less popular because of the console released in Japan. Companies such as Nintendo and SEGA released their respective consoles which could be played at home and only had a one-time fee, making them more affordable than the arcade. He also mentions the future in which “it” will fit in your hand, which is probably talking about the popularity of handheld consoles and phones.<br>This last verse is the downfall of the cabinet man, he describes it as being hard to breathe probably because he wasn’t getting quarters anymore. The arcade is empty and it’s Christmas Eve when kids are probably receiving consoles, making him obsolete. This is when someone breaks into the arcade, they start to paint on his cabinet. They then start smashing him with a crowbar destroying the screen and opening the quarter compartment. They shove him and push him over, and the robber looks down to see the blood from the cabinet man soaking into their sneakers.<br>This song paints a sad picture of what the man’s initial life was like from the clues put throughout the song. He mostly likely leads a depressing and sad life with no one to love him and saw people’s love towards arcade machines and became jealous. He became deranged turning himself into an arcade machine just to feel loved. His morals also became messed up as he didn’t care for human life but became fixed on how people played his game. When people cheated it made him feel disrespected or violated and he would hurt the player as it was not how he intended people to play his game. As people gradually went away from arcade games he became lonely and eventually died when some broke in and tried to steal his quarters.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on May 18, 2021</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/authors/asher-griess/" class="invert" rel="author">Asher Griess</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/ruler-of-everything.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Ruler Of Everything</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/touch-tone-telephone.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Touch-Tone Telephone </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
