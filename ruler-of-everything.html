Throughout the song, the common themes of death, egotism, and time are present. Many of the lines have alternate meanings that contrast with what is explicitly stated, making the song harder to understand. It follows a character named Juno who is egotistical and tries to always be perceived well. This idea is expressed throughout the song in a variety of ways and is reinforced a multitude of times.<br>Juno was upset because he had “been had” and shot at the sun. Calling the sun, “his wily one only friend” implying that he had been deceived by the sun. The sun represents the passing of time, especially in regards to the cycle of day and night which is directly caused by the sun. Consistent with the theme of time, the next line: “Every end of the time is another begun.” refers to the cycle of people having children and dying; the beginning of a new “time” coinciding with the end of another. Then the chorus is presented and it is about how mechanical hands are the rulers of everything. Mechanical hands are referring to the hands on a clock, and it is saying that even when you die time will still march onwards; when everyone is dead time will continue.<br>The next verse describes the self-centered nature of the man, which is alluded to by the mention of his zirconium pants. Zirconium is an element commonly used in jewelry to mimic diamonds, which represents the facade he presents to others. He then asks: “Do you like how I walk? Do you like how I talk? Do you like how my face disintegrates into chalk?” a reference to the mortality of humans. He then describes himself as powerful and provides the detail that his wife calls him self-centered. A series of admissions follow this: he practices his mannerisms to impress others, the mirror must be unclear because he should be taller, he is obsessed with his luck, and that he has been living a lie. Not only has he managed to trick those around him but he has tricked himself into believing that he is greater than everyone else, becoming obsessed with impressing others and improving his self-image.<br>This is where the song starts to speed up dramatically to symbolize the flow of time. He still wants to continue to live as he has more to do, asking if the clock stops when you die. When you try to understand the concept of death and time you are unable to comprehend it and make irrational decisions. Doubt begins to gradually seep in, and he confronts head-on the inevitability of death, stating that to attempt to comprehend death would be foolish, and giving up is the only reasonable option. Finally, the man talks about how he flies through the sky without looking down, which means that he makes decisions without acknowledging the danger that these choices present. He then states that “[I’m] Scraping my face on the sky”, which draws parallels to the Greek myth of Icarus. In the story, Icarus and Daedalus create wings made of wax to fly, but when Icarus gets too close to the sun his wings melt and fall to his death. This is how the character of the story dies by taking unnecessary risks because he falls out of touch with reality. The song ends with his death, which is alluded to by the last verse slowly fading out.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on May 18, 2021</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/authors/asher-griess/" class="invert" rel="author">Asher Griess</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/why-the-world-burns.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Why The World Burns</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/cabinet-man.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Cabinet Man </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
