Despite working there for a long time with decent pay, he is struggling to make enough money to live comfortably. <span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">His boss stated that he was giving enough money for comfortable living, and enough for his entire family.

The room also had a box of earplugs in at the door for those needing to ask questions. He stated that he needed to type loud in order to perform the best at his job. He specifically uses cherry MX blue mechanical keyboards to work, with many replacements on standby in case he breaks.</span></p><p>“I need to make sure that I am always performing my best. Since I break my keyboards almost weekly, I have many replacements just in case. This job is very important to me, so I want to be the best I can possibly be. This is what it takes to be the best at IT.”<br>    Matt also struggles with many different health issues from work, such as tendinitis, poor posture, stiff shoulders, headaches, trouble sleeping, permanent hearing loss, and lack of skin of the fingertips. When<span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);"> we asked people around the office they had a lot to say about Matt. Many told us about how good of an IT guy that he was, claiming that he was the single reason the company was still going. We also got many opinions on his pay, most stating that it should be increased. Some workers even broke into tears when asked about their opinion on Matt because they appreciated him so much.</span></p><p>    Not only is Matt working hard to be at his best, his wife is also helping him out with this effort.Matt’s wife currently is working three other jobs for 90 hours a week to help Matt with his IT career. When we asked her about the jobs that she has had to take this is what she said.<br>“IT is a really important field, it brings a lot to society as a whole. Matt is trying so hard to help, he needed more money to keep working. So, I was of course excited that I could help him do his job even better. I may not have much time to see my kids or the money to feed them, but it's worth it co<span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);">nsidering how good of a job he is doing.
