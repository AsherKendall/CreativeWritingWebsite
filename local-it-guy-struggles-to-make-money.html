The room also had a box of earplugs in at the door for those needing to ask questions. He stated that he needed to type loud in order to perform the best at his job. He specifically uses cherry MX blue mechanical keyboards to work, with many replacements on standby in case he breaks.</span></p><p>“I need to make sure that I am always performing my best. Since I break my keyboards almost weekly, I have many replacements just in case. This job is very important to me, so I want to be the best I can possibly be. This is what it takes to be the best at IT.”<br>    Matt also struggles with many different health issues from work, such as tendinitis, poor posture, stiff shoulders, headaches, trouble sleeping, permanent hearing loss, and lack of skin of the fingertips. When<span style="color: var(--text-editor-body-color); font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; font-weight: var(--font-weight-normal);"> we asked people around the office they had a lot to say about Matt. Many told us about how good of an IT guy that he was, claiming that he was the single reason the company was still going. We also got many opinions on his pay, most stating that it should be increased. Some workers even broke into tears when asked about their opinion on Matt because they appreciated him so much.</span></p><p>    Not only is Matt working hard to be at his best, his wife is also helping him out with this effort.Matt’s wife currently is working three other jobs for 90 hours a week to help Matt with his IT career.
