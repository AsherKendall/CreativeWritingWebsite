Reports say that the students' bodies have possibly been there for 71 days. The cause of death of the students is currently unknown, but medical professionals have described that the students died at similar times due to dehydration or starvation.<br>Katherine Renner was the teacher of the algebra class until she noticed that students were no longer living. Supposedly the students died sometime after the teacher told the students to veg out. The teacher, not knowing of the students’ death, would continue to teach the lessons for around 2 months. We asked her about the incident and this is what she had to say,”  I just thought they were tired or shy, they wouldn’t answer any of my questions. I was starting to wonder if they really understood the topics, they wouldn’t turn in any homework. I also had to remind them to wear deodorant daily because it started to smell.”<br>    Janitors also reported that they saw the students after school hours, when we asked this is what they said,” They just looked like they were very focused on doing their work so I let them be.”<br>    It wasn’t until around 2 months when another teacher came in to borrow a Chromebook that they were discovered to be dead. The teacher discovered that the students were dead, and is now on paid leave after the incident. When asked how she figured out they were dead she had this to say,” You can easily tell that they were dead, their bodies were ****ing rotting. Their limbs were literally falling off.”<br>    The students also won many different awards during this time such as a student of the month, AP scholar, perfect attendance awards, honor rolls, many other awards. Most of the students’ GPAs actually went up during the two months. This is what their teacher had to say,” I really thought they were just excelling in class, but it turned out that they were dead.”<br>    Since the incident, the school board has been putting forth the idea of mandated classes for teachers on how to identify dead bodies. This would take place over the summer and teach symptoms of death, how to identify a dead body, and what to do when there is a dead body. There has been resistance to this idea as the teachers believe it will not help, we asked the biology teacher and this is what she said,” Do you know how hard it is to tell the difference? Teenagers and dead teenagers are exactly the same. There is no way to tell, we aren’t paid enough for this.”<br>    There are many different online resources that can help you identify a dead body.
