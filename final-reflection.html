In all the other classes I have struggled to enjoy any of the classwork at hand, mostly because of the lack of choice in what exactly I write. This time I decided that I would not go with what I thought would be easy, but what I thought would be the most enjoyable for me to write. As I continued throughout the semester you can see my writing changing more and more to fit this theme. I wanted to create something that not only I liked making, but something that others would probably enjoy.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">I started out writing about my grandma’s death for the personal narrative which I finished, but I did feel stratified with. To be honest, I hated writing about it, and it was painful to write about it. But at the time I couldn’t think of what to write about that would be personal other than that. Then I got excited about creating an essay on Minecraft. It was much easier to come up with ideas and thinking about the memories gave some nostalgia. When I was done I was much more stratified and felt more contempt with my project as a whole. This is when I decided that I was going to try to make an essay that I wanted to make, as they seemed to be a lot better when I tried to force it.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">While writing my nonfiction I had many ideas for but I think that I had too many and ended up confused about what to write because I was trying to incorporate too many ideas at once. I didn’t understand what I was trying to convey in my piece so it ended up somewhat lackluster. I did get some enjoyment out of creating some of the details of the piece and toying with the individual ideas of the piece. So I did learn that I shouldn’t try too many things at once, or it could become a mess. In the poetry unit, I could focus more on a specific song and that helped me keep my ideas together. I had fun trying to understand the characters and figure out the story and what certain phrases meant. I did find it a little boring to write out the ideas that I had already come up with though, but it overall was a success. </span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">For my choice project I choice satire new articles, this was because I talked to my friends about made-up stories like that a lot. I was able to write about something that I could easily come up with ideas for, in fact, I had too many ideas. I couldn’t incorporate them all into the articles, but this time around I pick and chose what I wanted. I even came up with ideas that I thought of but I knew I couldn’t make them into articles so I just made them as related articles.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">    </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Overall this was a very successful semester as I learned a lot of new things about writing, and about myself with writing. I don’t think that I will ever want to go back to writing about topics that I find boring now that I know what I like. This class has been a great help in discovering myself in writing and just what I can do when I find something I like. I have come out of this class as a completely different writer.</span></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on May 19, 2021</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/authors/asher-griess/" class="invert" rel="author">Asher Griess</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/reflections.html" class="invert post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> Reflections</a></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2021-05-19T00:18" class="feed__date">May 19, 2021</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/reflections.html" class="invert">Reflections</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Powered by <a href="https://getpublii.com" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Publii</a></p></div><button class="footer__bttop js-footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top"><svg><title>Back to top</title><use xlink:href="https://asherkendall.github.io/CreativeWritingWebsite/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
